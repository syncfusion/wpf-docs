# Key Features in WPF Bullet Graph (SfBulletGraph)

[`SfBulletGraph`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.BulletGraph.SfBulletGraph.html) is Composite UI element with following sub-parts:

* Ticks
* Label
* Caption
* Range
* Feature Measure

## Ticks

Ticks are scale indicator which is used to specify the values on quantitative scale.

## Label

A quantitative scale label specifies the numeric value according to the major ticks in the range of the scale.

## Caption

The [`Caption`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.BulletGraph.SfBulletGraph.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_BulletGraph_SfBulletGraph_Caption) for a bullet graph is used to specify a unique label describing the value represented in the bullet graph. 

## Range

A qualitative range is a visual element that ends at a specified RangeEnd at the beginning of the previous rangeâ€™s RangeEnd. The qualitative ranges are arranged according to each [`RangeEnd`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.BulletGraph.QualitativeRange.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_BulletGraph_QualitativeRange_RangeEnd) value.

## Performance measure

### Featured measure

[`FeaturedMeasure`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.BulletGraph.SfBulletGraph.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_BulletGraph_SfBulletGraph_FeaturedMeasure) is used to display the primary data, or the current value of the data that you are measuring. It should usually be encoded as a bar, like the bar on a bar graph, and be prominent.

### Comparative measure

[`ComparativeMeasure`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.BulletGraph.SfBulletGraph.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_BulletGraph_SfBulletGraph_ComparativeMeasure) should be less visually dominant than the featured measure. It should always be encoded as a short line that runs perpendicular to the orientation of the graph. A good example would be a target for YTD revenue. Whenever the featured measure intersects a comparative measure, the comparative measure should appear behind the featured measure.

## Bullet graphs type

The Bullet Graph types can be differed by its orientation of the control, the control direction may be **horizontal** or **vertical**.

### Easy to use ###

SfBulletGraph is available in Visual Studio toolbox itself, you can easily drag and drop the control from toolbox.

## Data Binding Support ##

The control can be bound to your application data from a variety of data sources in the form of binding declaration or by setting its properties directly.

## MVVM support ##

The Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern is to be followed to get better control customization.
