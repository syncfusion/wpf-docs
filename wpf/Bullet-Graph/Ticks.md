# Ticks in WPF Bullet Graph (SfBulletGraph)

Quantitative scale is displayed with two types of ticks: 

* Major ticks, the primary scale indicators.
* Minor ticks, the secondary scale indicators that fall in between the major ticks.

## Customizing Ticks

The Interval property is used to calculate the Major tick count for a SfBulletGraph. Like ticks, small ticks are calculated using the MinorTicksPerInterval property.

The stroke of the major and minor ticks is customized by setting the **MajorTickStroke** and **MinorTickStroke** properties. The size can be modified by using the **MajorTickSize** and **MinorTickSize** properties. By setting **MajorTickStrokeThickness** and **MinorTickStrokeThickness**, the strokeâ€™s thickness can be customized.

    <syncfusion:SfBulletGraph   Interval="2"

                                MajorTickSize="15"
                                MinorTickSize="10"

                                MinorTickStroke="Green">            
        </syncfusion:SfBulletGraph>

      SfBulletGraph bulletgraph = new SfBulletGraph();
      bulletgraph.MinorTicksPerInterval = 3;
      bulletgraph.MajorTickSize = 15;
      bulletgraph.MinorTickSize = 10;
      bulletgraph.MajorTickStroke = new SolidColorBrush(Colors.Red);
      bulletgraph.MinorTickStroke = new SolidColorBrush(Colors.Green);
      this.Grid.Children.Add(bulletgraph);

## TickPosition

The ticks in the scale can be placed above or below the ranges of the quantitative scale by choosing the options available in the **TickPosition** property. 

They are:

1. Below (Default)
2. Above
3. Cross

{% tabs %}
{% highlight xaml %}

    <syncfusion:SfBulletGraph   TickPosition="Cross">
    </syncfusion:SfBulletGraph>

{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight c# %}

    SfBulletGraph bulletgraph = new SfBulletGraph();
    bulletgraph.TickPosition = BulletGraphTicksPosition.Cross; 
    this.Grid.Children.Add(bulletgraph);

{% endhighlight %}
