# Localization in WPF Schedule (Classic)

Localization is the process of customizing the user interface based on a culture specific to a particular country or region in order to display regional data. The culture is represented by a unique string, for example, ―en-US‖ for U.S. English and ―fr‖ for French (common).

Localization is the key feature that provides solutions to global customers with the help of localized resource files provided by the control. The Scheduler supports localization, and you can create a resource file for any culture to be applied in the schedule.

## Set Current UI Culture to the Application
Application culture can be changed by setting [CurrentUICulture](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.globalization.cultureinfo.currentuiculture.aspx)

{% tabs %}
{% highlight c# %}

public MainWindow()
{
    this.InitializeComponent();
    //Download resx files from GitHub. https://github.com/syncfusion/wpf-demos/tree/master/Schedule/Localization/CS/Resources
    System.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture = new System.Globalization.CultureInfo("fr-FR");
    System.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture = new CultureInfo("fr-FR");
}

{% endhighlight  %}
{% endtabs %}

## Localization using Resource file

To localize the Scheduler based on `CurrentUICulture` using resource files, follow the below steps. 

1.Create new folder and named as **Resources** in your application. 
2.Add the default resource file of Scheduler into **Resources** folder. You can download the Syncfusion.SfSchedule.WPF.resx [here](https://github.com/syncfusion/wpf-demos/blob/master/Schedule/Localization/CS/Resources/Syncfusion.SfSchedule.WPF.resx).

3.Right-click on the Resources folder, select **Add** and then **NewItem**.

4.In `Add New Item` wizard, select the **Resource File** option and name the filename as **Syncfusion.SfSchedule.WPF.&lt;culture name&gt;.resx**. For example, you have to give name as **Syncfusion.SfSchedule.WPF.de.resx** for German culture.
 
5.The culture name that indicates the name of language and country.
