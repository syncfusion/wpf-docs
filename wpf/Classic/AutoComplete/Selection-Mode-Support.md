# Selection Mode Support in WPF AutoComplete (Classic)

AutoComplete supports two kinds of Selection Mode namely Single and Multiple. You can select the Mode using the [SelectionMode](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.Windows.Tools.Controls.AutoComplete.html#Syncfusion_Windows_Tools_Controls_AutoComplete_SelectionMode) property. 

When the [SelectionMode](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.Windows.Tools.Controls.AutoComplete.html#Syncfusion_Windows_Tools_Controls_AutoComplete_SelectionMode) property is set as Single, only one item can be selected at a time. The following image illustrates the Single selection mode.

When the [SelectionMode](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.Windows.Tools.Controls.AutoComplete.html#Syncfusion_Windows_Tools_Controls_AutoComplete_SelectionMode) is set as Multiple, you can select multiple items by using the [SeparatorChar](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.Windows.Tools.Controls.AutoComplete.html#Syncfusion_Windows_Tools_Controls_AutoComplete_SeparatorChar) property to separate the selected items. By default the SeparatorChar is “;”. This allows you to select multiple items by using the [SelectionMode](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.Windows.Tools.Controls.AutoComplete.html#Syncfusion_Windows_Tools_Controls_AutoComplete_SelectionMode) property. Once an item is selected the [SeparatorChar](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.Windows.Tools.Controls.AutoComplete.html#Syncfusion_Windows_Tools_Controls_AutoComplete_SeparatorChar) is to be entered in the text box to select the next item.

The following image illustrates the Multiple selection mode.

When the [SelectionMode](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.Windows.Tools.Controls.AutoComplete.html#Syncfusion_Windows_Tools_Controls_AutoComplete_SelectionMode) is set as Extended, you can select multiple items at a time by pressing the Ctrl key. While selecting the multiple items, the selected items will be separated by the [SeparatorChar](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.Windows.Tools.Controls.AutoComplete.html#Syncfusion_Windows_Tools_Controls_AutoComplete_SeparatorChar) automatically.

The following image illustrates the Multiple selection mode.
