# VS2010-Designer-support in WPF GridDataControl (Classic)

GridDataControl provides rich design time experience by associating a designer. This allows the users to modify the various grid settings to change the look and feel of the grid.

The grid designer is populated with numerous options when ItemsSource assigned to the grid. This enables the users to edit the basic grid properties and the properties of individual column. Changes in any of these properties in the designer have an immediate impact on its XAML code and hence the designer makes the grid more user-friendly.

## Activating Designer

1. Open Design window.

2. Right-click on the grid.

   N> An edit menu opens.
