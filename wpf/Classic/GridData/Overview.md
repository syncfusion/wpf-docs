# WPF GridDataControl (Classic) Overview

The grid at its core functions as a very efficient display engine for tabular data that can be customized down to the cell level. It does not make any assumptions on the structure of the data (many grid controls implemented as straight data-bound controls make such explicit assumptions). This leads to a very flexible design that can be easily adapted to a variety of tasks including the display of completely unstructured data and the display of structured data from a database. 

The display system also hosts a powerful and complete styles architecture. Settings can be specified at the cell level or higher levels using parent styles that are referred to as base styles. Base styles can affect groups of cells. Cell level settings override any higher-level settings and enable easy customization right down to the cell level.

With this version, our core focus has been on the underlying architecture for displaying cells with virtualized cell editors in a manner that enables good performance characteristics. The core display system also supports several building-block features such as nested grids, virtual modes, and support for a virtually unlimited number of rows and columns.
