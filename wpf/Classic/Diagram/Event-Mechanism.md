# Event Mechanism in WPF Diagram (classic)

This section describes several events triggered and handled while using Essential Diagram WPF in the following topic:

## Events for Nodes and Connections

Diagram control has several events which respond to several actions performed on nodes and connections.

The various events and their descriptions are explained in the following table.

The events can be specified using DiagramView object as follows.

* For instance, NodeClick event can be specified in the following way.
{% highlight html %}




<sfdiagram:DiagramView Name="diagramView" NodeClick="diagramView_NodeClick">

</sfdiagram:DiagramView> 


{% endhighlight  %}
{% highlight c# %}




diagramView.NodeClick += new NodeEventHandler(diagramView_NodeClick);
{% endhighlight  %}
{% highlight vbnet %}






AddHandler diagramView.NodeClick, AddressOf diagramView_NodeClick

{% endhighlight %}

* And then the event handler can be specified in the code behind as follows.
{% highlight c# %}




//Event Handler

void diagramView_NodeClick(object sender, NodeRoutedEventArgs evtArgs)

{

//user specified code

}

{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight vbnet %}





'Event Handler

Private Sub diagramView_NodeClick(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal evtArgs As NodeRoutedEventArgs)

     'user specified code

End Sub

{% endhighlight %}

* As another example, the ConnectorDoubleClick event can be specified in the following way.
{% highlight html %}




<sfdiagram:DiagramView Name="diagramView" ConnectorDoubleClick="diagramView_ConnectorDoubleClick">

</sfdiagram:DiagramView>

{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight c# %}




diagramView.ConnectorDoubleClick += new ConnChangedEventHandler(diagramView_ConnectorDoubleClick);

{% endhighlight  %}
{% highlight vbnet %}




AddHandler diagramView.ConnectorDoubleClick, AddressOf diagramView_ConnectorDoubleClick

{% endhighlight %}

And then the event handler can be specified in the code behind as follows.
{% highlight c# %}




// Event Handler

void diagramView_ConnectorDoubleClick(object sender, ConnRoutedEventArgs evtArgs)

{

// user specified code

}

{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight vbnet %}





'Event Handler

Private Sub diagramView_ConnectorDoubleClick(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal evtArgs As ConnRoutedEventArgs)

     'user specified code

End Sub

{% endhighlight  %}

* NodeMoved and NodeDrop events
{% highlight c# %}




diagramView.NodeMoved += new NodeNudgeEventHandler(diagramView_NodeMoved);

void diagramView_NodeMoved(object sender, NodeNudgeEventArgs evtArgs)

{

}



diagramView.NodeDrop += new NodeNudgeEventHandler(diagramView_LineMoved);

void diagramView_NodeDrop(object sender, NodeNudgeEventArgs evtArgs)

{

}

{% endhighlight  %}
{% highlight vbnet %}





Private diagramView.NodeMoved += New NodeNudgeEventHandler(AddressOf diagramView_NodeMoved)

Private Sub diagramView_NodeMoved(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal evtArgs As NodeNudgeEventArgs)

End Sub



Private diagramView.NodeDrop += New NodeNudgeEventHandler(AddressOf diagramView_LineMoved)

Private Sub diagramView_NodeDrop(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal evtArgs As NodeNudgeEventArgs)

End Sub
{% endhighlight  %}
