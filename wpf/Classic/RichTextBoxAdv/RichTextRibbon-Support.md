# RichTextRibbon-Support in WPF RichTextBoxAdv (Classic)

RichTextBoxAdv has RichTextRibbon support to format the text, paragraph, and so on. It provides a Microsoft Word look and feel.

The Syncfusion.RichTextRibbon.WPF assembly is required to add this RichTextRibbon in the application. RichTextRibbon has been inherited from the Ribbon control. When this control is dragged and dropped over the designer, items will be automatically serialized. Setting the DataContext to RichTextBoxAdv will automatically bind the commands.
