# Touch-Events in WPF RichTextBoxAdv (Classic)

The RichTextBoxAdv control provides support for touch manipulation like panning, zooming, and selecting the content of the document.

Panning: With the touch manipulation event, we can interpret the multi-touch input to simulate directly manipulating the viewer and allow users to use their finger to scroll over the contents of the RichTextBoxAdv control.

Zooming: With the touch manipulation event, we can interpret multi-touch input to simulate directly manipulating the viewer and allow users to use their fingers to zoom in and out the contents of the RichTextBoxAdv control.

Selection: With the touch manipulation event, we can interpret the multi-touch input to simulate directly manipulating the contents rendered on the viewer and allow users to use their fingers to perform select content similar to using a mouse.

N> By default, the IsManipulationEnabled property of the RichTextBoxAdv control is set to false and touch manipulations are disabled. In order to enable touch manipulation in the RichTextBoxAdv control, set the IsManipulationEnabled property to true.
