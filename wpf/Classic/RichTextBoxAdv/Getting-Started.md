# Getting Started with WPF RichTextBoxAdv (Classic)

N> Starting with v16.2.0.41 (2018 Vol 2), if you reference Syncfusion assemblies from trial setup or from the NuGet feed, you also have to add "Syncfusion.Licensing" assembly reference and include a license key in your projects. Please refer to this [link](https://help.syncfusion.com/common/essential-studio/licensing/license-key) to know about registering Syncfusion license key in your WPF application to use our components.
