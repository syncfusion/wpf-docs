# Statistical Formula and Utility Functions in WPF Chart (Classic)

This feature allows the user to calculate basic statistical functions that include mean, median, standard deviation, variance, variance based estimator, variance unbased estimator, correlation coefficient and covariance, ANOVA, T-test, Z-test, and F-test performed based on sample series, and utility functions like normal distribution, T-cumulative distribution and F-cumulative distribution.

## Use Case Scenarios

1. This feature supports built-in statistical formulas.
2. The curve in the graph can be drawn based on normal distribution, T-cumulative distribution, and F-cumulative distribution.
3. Basic functions like mean, median, and standard deviation can be obtained from the series drawn.
