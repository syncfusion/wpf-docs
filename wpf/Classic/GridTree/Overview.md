# WPF GridTreeControl (Classic) Overview

The grid at its core functions as a very efficient display engine for tabular data that can be customized down to the cell level. It does not make any assumptions on the structure of the data (many grid controls implemented as straight data-bound controls make such explicit assumptions). This leads to a very flexible design that can be easily adapted to a variety of tasks including the display of completely unstructured data and the display of structured data from a database. 

The display system also hosts a powerful and complete styles architecture. Settings can be specified at the cell level or higher levels using parent styles that are referred to as base styles. Base styles can affect groups of cells. Cell level settings override any higher-level settings and enable easy customization right down to the cell level.

With this version, our core focus has been on the underlying architecture for displaying cells with virtualized cell editors in a manner that enables good performance characteristics. The core display system also supports several building-block features such as nested grids, virtual modes, and support for a virtually unlimited number of rows and columns.

## Feature Summary

This section provides basic information, such as definitions and usage, regarding important features of EssentialGrid.

## Overview in WPF GridTreeControl (Classic)Control 

The GridTree control is a dynamic data-bound control used to present hierarchical data.

### Data Binding

The GridTree control supports all popular data sources including observable collections, data tables, and binding lists.

Data sources can be bound to the GridTree control by either directly binding ItemsSource with the relational information or by retrieving node elements dynamically with the RequestTreeItems event. RequestTreeItems will load the data in an on-demand basis.

For instance, a database may have 100,000 records in it; in the first approach (binding ItemSource) you have to set ItemsSource of GridTreeControl, and it will take care of populating root and child nodes. But in the second approach, you have to dynamically pass the source of the root and child by handling the RequestTreeItems event. The child element will load only when the parent node expands. 

Data Presentation: Cell Types

Several built-in cell types can be used to display and edit any underlying data type. The following cell types are available:

* Static-text cells.
* Check-box cells. 
* Button cells.
* Image cells.
* Combo-box cells. 
* Drop-down list cells. 
* Currency cells.
* Date-time cells.
* Double edit cells.
* Integer edit cells.
* Mask edit cells.
* Percent edit cells.
* Rich-text-box cells.
* Up-down edit cells.

## Interactive Features

The GridTree control provides an effective option for sorting. Also, its appearance can easily be customized through an API that can be used to set different types of glyphs such as triangles, plus and minus signs, and tree lines in various brush styles. By handling the GlyphDrawing event on the cell renderer, you can draw custom expand-and-collapse glyphs. The GridTree control also supports placing images next to expand-and-collapse glyphs.

## Serialization

The GridTree control supports XML serialization to preserve and restore a grid’s schema and style settings. All styles and properties that reflect the state of the Grid can be serialized.
