# Populate Data in WPF Maps (SfMap)

This section explains how to populate shape data for providing data input to the maps control and usage of the [`ItemsSource`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Maps.ShapeFileLayer.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Maps_ShapeFileLayer_ItemsSource) property.

## Data binding

The maps control supports data binding using the [`ItemsSource`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Maps.ShapeFileLayer.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Maps_ShapeFileLayer_ItemsSource) property in the shape layers.

The following properties in shape layers are used for binding data in the maps control:

* ItemsSource
* ShapeIDPath
* ShapeIDTableField

### ItemsSource

This is the basic property that exposes data binding for Maps. [`ItemsSource`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Maps.ShapeFileLayer.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Maps_ShapeFileLayer_ItemsSource) is the property that accepts the collection type values. For example, the ItemsSource property accepts the ObservableCollections, Lists, and LinqResult values.

### ShapeIDPath

[`ShapeIDPath`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Maps.ShapeFileLayer.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Maps_ShapeFileLayer_ShapeIDPath) is the string type property used to refer to the ID of a shape from the ItemsSource. The ItemsSource property must have a property with name of the ShapeIDPath. The ShapeIDPath and the ShapeIDTableField properties are related to each other (refer to ShapeIDTableField for more details).

### ShapeIDTableField

The [`ShapeIDTableField`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Maps.ShapeFileLayer.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Maps_ShapeFileLayer_ShapeIDTableField) property is similar to the ShapeIDPath. It is a string type property that refers to the column name in the dbf file to identify the shape. When values of the ShapeIDPath property in the ItemsSource and the value of ShapeIDTableField in the .dbf file match, then the associated object from the ItemsSource is bound to the corresponding shape.

### ShapeValuePath

[`ShapeValuePath`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Maps.ShapeSetting.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Maps_ShapeSetting_ShapeValuePath) is a string type property used to define the object bound to the shapes of the map. The ShapeValuePath must be the name of any property that is defined in the ItemsSource items. The ShapeIDPath, ShapeIDTableField, and ShapeValue paths are dependent upon one another. Without specifying the ShapeIDPath and ShapeIDTableField, ShapeValuePath has no effect. When ShapeIDPath and ShapeIDTableField are properly set as mentioned in the Data Binding section, the ShapeValuePath has an impact on the map.

### Role of DBF file in Data Binding

The .dbf file that is included in the main shape file, is required to work with data binding. The .dbf file contains the information about the shapes in the main shape file. Each record in the .dbf file is associated with the each shape in the main file. Shapes in the main file and records in the .dbf file are organized in the same sequence. Therefore, the Nth shape in the main file is associated with Nth record in the .dbf file. A record of the .dbf file can contain the name of the shape or population data or some other statistical data of a geographic shape.
