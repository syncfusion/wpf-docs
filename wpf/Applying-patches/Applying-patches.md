## Patch Assembly Version Format
   
In the patch assembly, the **File Version** and **Product Version** will be different. Product Version will be the release version and File Version will be the increment of the release version's **revision** number. For each patch, the File Version will be a different one. You can differentiate between the build and patch assemblies by File Version.
