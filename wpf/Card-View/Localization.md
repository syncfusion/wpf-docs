# Localization in WPF Card View

Localization is the process of translating the application resources into different language for the specific cultures. You can localize the CardView by [adding resource file](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/visualstudio/visual-studio-2010/aa992030(v=vs.100)). Application culture can be changed by setting [CurrentUICulture]([CurrentUICulture](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.globalization.cultureinfo.currentuiculture?view=netframework-4.7.2)) after `InitializeComponent` method. 

Below application culture changed to French.

{% tabs %}

{% highlight C# %}

public MainWindow()
{
    InitializeComponent();
    System.Threading.Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentUICulture = new System.Globalization.CultureInfo("fr-FR");
}    

{% endhighlight %}

{% endtabs %}


To localize the CardView based on [CurrentUICulture](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.globalization.cultureinfo.currentuiculture?view=netframework-4.7.2) using resource files, follow the below steps. 

**Step 1:** Create new folder and named as **Resources** in your application. 

**Step 2:** Right-click on the Resources folder, select **Add** and then **NewItem**.

**Step 3:** In `Add New Item` wizard, select the **Resource File** option and name the filename as **Syncfusion.Tools.Wpf.&lt;culture name&gt;.resx**. For example, you have to give name as **Syncfusion.Tools.Wpf.fr-FR.resx** for French culture.
