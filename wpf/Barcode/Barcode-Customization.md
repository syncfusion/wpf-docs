# Barcode Customization in WPF Barcode (SfBarcode)

The color of the barcode can be customized by modifying the DarkBarBrush and LightBarBrush properties of the barcode control. 

{% highlight html %}

<sync:SfBarcode x:Name="barcode" Text="82698640929" DarkBarBrush=”Red” LightBarBrush="Blue” Symbology="QRBarcode"/>

{% endhighlight  %}


The DarkBarBrush represents the color of the dark bar (Black color usually) and the LightBarBrush represents the color of the gap between two adjacent black bars (White color usually).

N> The DarkBarBrush and LightBarBrush customizations are applicable only for one dimensional barcodes. In order for a barcode symbol to be recognized by a scanner, there must be an adequate contrast between the dark bars and the light spaces and not all the barcode scanners have support for colored barcodes.
