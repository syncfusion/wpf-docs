# WPF DateTimePicker (DateTimeEdit) Overview

The [DateTimeEdit](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.Windows.Shared.DateTimeEdit.html) allows you to quickly navigate and select dates using months, years, and decades of calendar. The `DateTimeEdit` comprises text box and a dropdown with calendar and clock to pick or edit a date with time. It supports data binding, null value, maximum and minimum dates, date validation, watermark, culture and much more. It also provides flexible options for displaying the date-time according to the format required, as well as many customization options to enhance its appearance.
