# OlapDataProvider in WPF OLAP Common

The database connectivity related works are all taken care of by this part of the base. Here, the  Microsoft.AnalysisService.AdomdClient data provider is used. Establishing the connection, checking the state of the connection, and closing the connection are basic operations provided by the general data provider, but some more information is required to provide the input for controls.

This part of the base will get the connection information and establish a connection with the specified data source and retrieve the information from the database and store it in its classes. This part of the base has the required logic to retrieve the information from the database and store it in the object of class in data namespace.

 All the information about the connected cube will intersect and store in the object of classes in the data namespace, which are equivalent to the classes in the AdomdClient. This information is required to provide the input for OLAP controls.

Important class in DataProvider namespace:

* AdomdDataProvider

## AdomdDataProvider

The important properties and methods in AdomdDataProvider class are tabulated below:

###  Properties

* **CatalogName**: Gets the connected database name.
* **ConnectionString**: Sets or gets the connection string.
* **CurrentCellSet**: Gets the currently executed CellSet.
* **GetCubes**: Gets the information about the cubes in the connected data source.
