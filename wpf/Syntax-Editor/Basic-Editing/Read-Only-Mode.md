## Read Only Mode

Edit WPF can also be used as a static control in order to view only the contents of the file. ReadOnly mode is enabled/disabled by using the `IsReadOnly` property of the EditControl class. The following code is used to set the ReadOnly mode for EditControl.

{% tabs %}

{% highlight XAML %}


<sfedit:EditControl Name="editControl" IsReadOnly="True">

</sfedit:EditControl>



{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight C# %}

editControl.IsReadOnly = true;

{% endhighlight %}

{% endtabs %}
